# vimconfig
My Vim configuration - Raul Vasile

First you must have Vundle installed. 
To install Vundle, clone ``https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`` under ``~/.vim/bundle/``

After this use ``:PluginInstall`` while you are in Vim to install all plugins from .vimrc

If you are using Gnome Terminal and you have to have a nice colored status line, follow the instructions from here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/283908/how-can-i-install-and-use-powerline-plugin
